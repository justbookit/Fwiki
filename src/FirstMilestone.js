                        <p>Nowadays, a very frequent problem that many students from our country are dealing with at a weekly basis
                        is the problem of purchasing free train tickets. At first glance, the process seems to be simple. 
                        The only thing they have to do is to go to a ticket office in a railway station, to show the id card and
                        the student id received from their university which proves that they are enrolled in the current year
                        at a university and they should be good to go.
                        </p>

                        <p>The real problem is the endless queues that form at the ticket offices from the railway stations. In average a student
                        must wait at least 30 minutes in order to receive a ticket, which is very unpleasant, especially when they
                        find themselves in a hurry.
                        </p>

                        <p>At the railway stations there are automatic purchasing machines where people can buy tickets, but students cannot
                        take advantage of their free tickets rights when using these, because the purchasing machines do not have
                        a functionality for student tickets.
                        </p>

                        <p>Our solution aims to offer a web platform where students can book free train tickets,
                        eliminating the frustrating waiting at ticket offices. Also, we want to significantly
                        reduce the time that they spend to purchase a train ticket.
                        Our raw functionalities include the following:

                        <p>Of course, a validation mechanism that must decide if an user is for real a
                        student or not will be implemented. For the moment we will entrust in the train personnel to verify
                        if the data marked on the ticket is the same with the data on the travellerâ€™s personal id card.
                        In addition to this, we can associate in our database this pair: CNP - student card id.

                            the fact that they do not have access to an online platform that allows them to book

                        <p>Analyzing the aforementioned 'Softrans' example, it is common that many people would book seats
                        and proceed to not showing up when the train is set to leave. We took in consideration the 
                        people who are practicing this non-ethical activity, by stopping the user in cause to use our
                        platform, unless a small compensation is paid. Of course, if the user cancels the reservation
                        before in due time, the penalty will not be applied. The train personnel will send us a list of
                        people who travelled in every train in order to see which reservation were truly honored.

                        <p>Our web platform can be accessed from multiple devices: smartphone, tablet or laptop.</p>

                        <p>The main goal of our application is to reduce the time spent by the students when they want
                        to purchase a train ticket. So the main advantage of our application is that they can use it
                        to book train tickets with discount in just few minutes.

                        <p>The other platforms contains multiple information. Our platform is a dedicated one for the
                        purchasing train tickets. So, it has a simple design, it is user-frendly and intuitive.
                        The user can buy a ticket in just few clicks.

                        <p>Altough 'Mersul trenurilor' provides a great variaty of routes, it does not provide an option to
                        make a reservation for any of this routes. Our platform has access to each train company database
                        that has routes on our site, therefore we can perform a reservation directly on our site.

If they donâ€™t accept we can add this tax on the online purchases for the travelers and our platform would follow the example of applications like FoodPanda. It is true that even adds on the platform can be another way of income and would provide venues even though someone accesses our platform and doesnâ€™t buy a ticket.</p>
                                <p>Picturing a scenario, in a wagoon there is a limit of around 100 seats and a full ticket from Bucuresti to Focsani costs around 52 lei. If we imagine that 25% of those people used our platform, we would get 13 lei per wagon. This train circulates with at least 4 wagons so we would get 52 lei per train. This route is used by 13 trains a day so our venues from this route would be 676 lei per day or 20000 lei per month.</p>
